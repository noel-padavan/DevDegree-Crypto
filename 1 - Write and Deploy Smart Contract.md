# **Dev Degree Burst 2022**: Crypto for Skeptics Workshop

> **_This workshop was adapted from an official guide by [Etherium.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/)_**

# **Part 1**: How to Write and Deploy and Smart Contract

With NFTs bringing blockchain into the public eye, now is an excellent opportunity to understand the hype yourself by publishing your own NFT (ERC-721 Token) on the Ethereum blockchain!

There's a lot of buzz and big names names in the NFT space; Makersplace (recently set a record digital artwork sale at Christie‚Äôs for $69 Million), Dapper Labs (creators of NBA Top Shot & Crypto Kitties), OpenSea (the world‚Äôs largest NFT marketplace), Zora, Super Rare, NFTfi, Foundation, Enjin, Origin Protocol, Immutable, and more. While some of us may be more skeptical of this decentralized approach than others, let's take the opportunity to try to dig into this technology and understand a little bit more what is going on behind the scenes. As a high level introduction, maybe we can see how other assets could be created and shared, with pictures being just the beginning.

In this tutorial, we will walk through creating and deploying an ERC-721 smart contract on the Rinkeby test network using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) and [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/signup/eth) (don‚Äôt fret if you don‚Äôt understand what any of this means yet ‚Äî we will explain it!).

In `Part 2` of this tutorial we‚Äôll go through how we can use our smart contract to mint an NFT, and in `Part 3` we‚Äôll explain how to view your NFT on MetaMask and in OpenSea.

## **STEP 1: CONNECT TO THE ETHEREUM NETWORK**

There are a bunch of ways to make requests to the Ethereum blockchain, but to make things easy, we‚Äôll use a free account on [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/signup/eth), a blockchain developer platform and API that allows us to communicate with the Ethereum chain without having to run our own nodes.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll also take advantage of Alchemy‚Äôs developer tools for monitoring and analytics to understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood in our smart contract deployment. If you don‚Äôt already have an Alchemy account, you can sign up for free [here](https://alchemy.com/signup/eth).

## **STEP 2: CREATE YOUR APP (AND API KEY)**

Once you‚Äôve created an Alchemy account, you can generate an API key by creating an app. This will allow us to make requests to the Ropsten test network. Check out [this guide](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/guides/choosing-a-network) if you‚Äôre curious to learn more about test networks.

1. Navigate to the ‚ÄúCreate App‚Äù page in your Alchemy Dashboard by hovering over ‚ÄúApps‚Äù in the nav bar and clicking ‚ÄúCreate App‚Äù

![assets/create-your-app.png](assets/create-your-app.png)

2. Name your app (we chose ‚ÄúMy First NFT!‚Äù), offer a short description, leave it as ‚ÄúEtherium‚Äù for the Chain), and choose ‚ÄúRinkeby‚Äù for your network. (It has a depreciation notice but don't worry about that right now.)

![assets/configure-and-publish-your-app.png](assets/configure-and-publish-your-app.png)

3. Click `‚ÄúCreate app‚Äù` and that‚Äôs it! Your app should appear in the table below.

## **STEP 3: CREATE AN ETHEREUM ACCOUNT (ADDRESS)**

We need an Ethereum account to send and receive transactions. For this tutorial, we‚Äôll use MetaMask, a virtual wallet in the browser used to manage your Ethereum account address. If you want to understand more about how transactions on Ethereum work, check out [this page](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/) from the Ethereum foundation.

You can download and create a MetaMask account for free [here](https://metamask.io/download.html). When you are creating an account‚Äîor if you already have an account‚Äîmake sure to switch over to the "Rinkeby Test Network‚Äù in the upper right (so that we‚Äôre not dealing with real money).

`hint` - be sure to make note of your 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase, when creating your account. Double check the spelling!

![assets/metamask-rinkeby.png](assets/metamask-rinkeby.png)

## **STEP 4: ADD ETHER FROM A FAUCET**

In order to deploy our smart contract to the test network, we‚Äôll need some fake ETH. To get ETH you can go to the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/) login with your Alchemy account, enter your MetaMask address, then finally click `‚ÄúSend me ETH"`. You should see ETH in your MetaMask account soon after! Make sure you're looking at your Rinkeby (fake money) account in MetaMask.

![assets/add-ether.png](assets/add-ether.png)

## **STEP 5: CHECK YOUR BALANCE**

To double check our balance is there, let‚Äôs make an [eth_getBalance](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-api-reference/json-rpc#eth_getbalance) request using [Alchemy‚Äôs composer tool](https://composer.alchemyapi.io/?composer_state=%7B%22network%22%3A0%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getBalance%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%22%22%2C%22latest%22%5D%7D). This will return the amount of ETH in our wallet. After you input your MetaMask account address (and switch to the Rinkeby Network), click ‚ÄúSend Request‚Äù. You should see a response like this:

```
`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "result": "0xde0b6b3a7640000"}`
```

**NOTE:** This result is in wei, not ETH. Wei is used as the smallest denomination of ether. The conversion from wei to ETH is 1 eth = 1018 wei. So if we convert 0xde0b6b3a7640000 to decimal we get 1\*1018 wei, which equals 1 ETH.

Phew! Our fake money is all there.

## **STEP 6: INITIALIZE OUR PROJECT**

First, we‚Äôll need to create a folder for our project. Navigate to your command line and type:

```
mkdir my-nft
cd my-nft
```

Now that we‚Äôre inside our project folder, we‚Äôll use npm init to initialize the project. You likely already have that installed, but if not, follow [these instructions using Homebrew](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/guides/alchemy-for-macs#1-install-nodejs-and-npm) (we‚Äôll also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), so download that too if you don't have it!).

```
npm init
```

It doesn‚Äôt really matter how you answer the installation questions; here is how we did it for reference:

```
package name: (my-nft)
version: (1.0.0)
description: My first NFT!
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
About to write to /Users/thesuperb1/Desktop/my-nft/package.json:

{
 "name": "my-nft",
 "version": "1.0.0",
 "description": "My first NFT!",
 "main": "index.js",
 "scripts": {
   "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
 },
 "author": "",
 "license": "ISC"
}
```

Approve the package.json, and we‚Äôre good to go!

## **STEP 7: INSTALL [HARDHAT](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview)**

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. It helps developers when building smart contracts and [dApps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) locally before deploying to the live chain.

Inside our my-nft project run:

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Check out this page for more details on [installation instructions](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview).

## **STEP 8: CREATE HARDHAT PROJECT**

Inside our project folder run:

```
npx hardhat
```

You should then see a welcome message and option to select what you want to do. Select `create an empty hardhat.config.js`:

```
888    888                      888 888               888

üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.0.11 üë∑‚Äç
? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶
 Create a basic sample project
 Create an advanced sample project
 Create an advanced sample project that uses TypeScript
‚ùØCreate an empty hardhat.config.js
 Quit
```

This will generate a hardhat.config.js file for us which is where we‚Äôll specify all of the set up for our project (on step 13).

## **STEP 9: ADD PROJECT FOLDERS**

To keep our project organized, we‚Äôll create two new folders. Navigate to the root directory of your project in your command line and type:

```
mkdir contracts
mkdir scripts
```

- `contracts/` is where we‚Äôll keep our NFT smart contract code
- `scripts/` is where we‚Äôll keep scripts to deploy and interact with our smart contract

## **STEP 10: WRITE OUR CONTRACT**

Now that our environment is set up, on to more exciting stuff: writing our smart contract code!

Open up the my-nft project in VSCode. Smart contracts are written in a language called Solidity which is what we will use to write our MyNFT.sol smart contract.‚Äå If you haven't already, install the [Solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) VSCode plugin to get syntax highlighting / debugging.

1. Navigate to the `contracts` folder and create a new file called `MyNFT.sol`

2. Our NFT smart contract code is based on the [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721) library‚Äôs ERC-721 implementation, all NFTs need to implement these protocols to be valid.

3. run `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts` to install the OpenZeppelin contracts library into our application.

4. Copy and paste the contents below into your `MyNFT.sol` file.

```js
//Contract based on [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721)
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
   using Counters for Counters.Counter;
   Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

   constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "NFT") {}

   function mintNFT(address recipient, string memory tokenURI)
       public onlyOwner
       returns (uint256)
   {
       _tokenIds.increment();

       uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
       _mint(recipient, newItemId);
       _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

       return newItemId;
   }
}

```

So, what does this code do exactly? Let‚Äôs break it down, line-by-line.

At the top of our smart contract, we import three [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) smart contract classes:

- `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol` contains the implementation of the ERC-721 standard, which our NFT smart contract will inherit. (To be a valid NFT, your smart contract must implement all the methods of the ERC-721 standard.) To learn more about the inherited ERC-721 functions, check out the interface definition here.

- `@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol` sets up [access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/access-control) on our smart contract, so only the owner of the smart contract (you) can mint NFTs. (Note, including access control is entirely a preference. If you'd like anyone to be able to mint an NFT using your smart contract, remove the word Ownable on line 10 and onlyOwner on line 17.)

After our import statements, we have our custom NFT smart contract, which is surprisingly short ‚Äî it only contains a counter, a constructor, and single function! This is thanks to our inherited OpenZeppelin contracts, which implement most of the methods we need to create an NFT, such as `ownerOf` which returns the owner of the NFT, and `transferFrom`, which transfers ownership of the NFT from one account to another.

In our ERC-721 constructor, you‚Äôll notice we pass 2 strings, ‚ÄúMyNFT‚Äù and ‚ÄúNFT.‚Äù The first variable is the smart contract‚Äôs name, and the second is its symbol. You can name each of these variables whatever you wish!

Finally, we have our function `mintNFT(address recipient, string memory tokenURI)` that allows us to mint an NFT! You'll notice this function takes in two variables:

- `address recipient` specifies the address that will receive your freshly minted NFT

- `string memory tokenURI` is a string that should resolve to a JSON document that describes the NFT's metadata. An NFT's metadata is really what brings it to life, allowing it to have configurable properties, such as a name, description, image, and other attributes. In part 2 of this tutorial, we will describe how to configure this metadata.

`mintNFT` calls some methods from the inherited ERC-721 library, and ultimately returns a number that represents the ID of the freshly minted NFT.

## **STEP 11: CONNECT METAMASK & ALCHEMY TO YOUR PROJECT**

Now that we‚Äôve created a MetaMask wallet, Alchemy account, and written our smart contract, it‚Äôs time to connect the three.

Every transaction sent from your virtual wallet requires a signature using your unique private key. To provide our program with this permission, we can safely store our private key (and Alchemy API key) in an environment file.

To learn more about sending transactions, check out [this tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/sending-transactions-using-web3-and-alchemy/) on sending transactions using web3.

First, install the dotenv package in your project directory:

```
npm install dotenv --save
```

Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory of our project, and add your MetaMask private key and HTTP Alchemy API URL to it.

- Follow [these instructions](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key) to export your private key from MetaMask

- See below to get HTTP Alchemy API URL and copy it to your clipboard

![assets/copy-alchemy-api-url.gif](assets/copy-alchemy-api-url.gif)

Your `.env` should now look like this:

```
API_URL="https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"
PRIVATE_KEY="your-metamask-private-key"
```

To actually connect these to our code, we‚Äôll reference these variables in our `hardhat.config.js` file on step 13.

> Don't commit `.env`! Please make sure never to share or expose your `.env` file with anyone, as you are compromising your secrets in doing so. If you are using version control, add your `.env` to a `.gitignore` file.

## **STEP 12: INSTALL ETHERS.JS**

[Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) is a library that makes it easier to interact and make requests to Ethereum by wrapping [standard JSON-RPC methods](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) with more user friendly methods.

Hardhat makes it super easy to integrate [Plugins](https://hardhat.org/plugins/) for additional tooling and extended functionality. We‚Äôll be taking advantage of the [Ethers plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-ethers.html) for contract deployment ([Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) has some super clean contract deployment methods).

In your project directory type:

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers@^5.0.0
```

We‚Äôll also require ethers in our `hardhat.config.js` in the next step.

## **STEP 13: UPDATE HARDHAT.CONFIG.JS**

We‚Äôve added several dependencies and plugins so far, now we need to update `hardhat.config.js` so that our project knows about all of them.

Update your `hardhat.config.js` to look like this:

```js
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
require('dotenv').config();
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');
const { API_URL, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.1',
  defaultNetwork: 'rinkeby',
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    rinkeby: {
      url: API_URL,
      accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],
    },
  },
};
```

## **STEP 14: COMPILE OUR CONTRACT**

To make sure everything is working so far, let‚Äôs compile our contract. The compile task is one of the built-in hardhat tasks.

From the command line run:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

You might get a warning about SPDX license identifier not provided in source file, or your Node version, but no need to worry about that ‚Äî hopefully everything else looks good!

## **STEP 15: WRITE OUR DEPLOY SCRIPT**

Now that our contract is written and our configuration file is good to go, it‚Äôs time to write our contract deploy script.

Navigate to the `scripts/` folder and create a new file called `deploy.js`, adding the following contents to it:

```js
async function main() {
  const MyNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory('MyNFT');

  // Start deployment, returning a promise that resolves to a contract object
  const myNFT = await MyNFT.deploy();
  await myNFT.deployed();
  console.log('Contract deployed to address:', myNFT.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Hardhat does an amazing job of explaining what each of these lines of code does in their [Contracts tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts.html#writing-tests), we‚Äôve adopted their explanations here.

```js
const MyNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory('MyNFT');
```

A `ContractFactory` in `ethers.js` is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts, so `MyNFT` here is a factory for instances of our NFT contract. When using the `hardhat-ethers` plugin `ContractFactory` and Contract instances are connected to the first signer by default.

```js
const myNFT = await MyNFT.deploy();
```

Calling `deploy()` on a `ContractFactory` will start the deployment, and return a `Promise` that resolves to a `Contract`. This is the object that has a method for each of our smart contract functions.

## **STEP 16: DEPLOY OUR CONTRACT**

We‚Äôre finally ready to deploy our smart contract! Navigate back to the root of your project directory, and in the command line run:

```
npx hardhat --network rinkeby run scripts/deploy.js
```

You should then see something like:

```
Contract deployed to address: 0x81c587EB0fE773404c42c1d2666b5f557C470eED
```

If we go to the [Rinkeby etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/) and search for our `contract address` we should be able to see that it has been deployed successfully. If you can't see it immediately, please wait a while as it can take some time. The transaction will look something like this:

![assets/etherscan-transaction.png](assets/etherscan-transaction.png)

The `From` address should match your `MetaMask` account address and the `To` address will say ‚ÄúContract Creation.‚Äù If we click into the transaction, we‚Äôll see our contract address in the `To` field:

![assets/etherscan-contract.png](assets/etherscan-contract.png)

Yasssss! You just deployed your NFT smart contract to the Ethereum chain!

To understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood, let‚Äôs navigate to the Explorer tab in our [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/explorer). If you have multiple Alchemy apps make sure to filter by app and select ‚ÄúMyNFT‚Äù.

![assets/alchemy-explorer.png](assets/alchemy-explorer.png)

Here you‚Äôll see a handful of `JSON-RPC` calls that Hardhat/Ethers made under the hood for us when we called the `.deploy()` function. Two important ones to call out here are `eth_sendRawTransaction`, which is the request to actually write our smart contract onto the Rinkeby chain, and `eth_getTransactionByHash` which is a request to read information about our transaction given the hash (a typical pattern when sending transactions). To learn more about sending transactions, check out this tutorial on [sending transactions using Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/sending-transactions-using-web3-and-alchemy/).

That‚Äôs all for `Part 1` of this tutorial. In `Part 2`, we‚Äôll actually interact with our smart contract by minting an NFT, and in `Part 3` we‚Äôll show you how to view your NFT in your Ethereum wallet!
