## **Getting Started**

Before beginning the workshop please watch this video, [WTF is an NFT](https://f.io/NtfMvoiR), created by our internal Broadcasting team. It does a great job at explaining what exactly NFTs are without getting to into the weeds. You'll also hear from members of our Blockchain team and get some direct examples of where NFTs may be going in the future. (Runtime: 6 minutes 49 seconds)

## **Get Creative**

NFTs can be so much more then just an image. The way NFTs work allow us to attach more meaning to NFTs then most people realise. One great examplke of this is Token-Gating, where an NFT acts as an access ticket to an event or community. Read our [write up about Token-Gating](https://www.shopify.ca/retail/token-gating) and check out this [video of our Token-Gating expirement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2djJhgfl91s) we ran at South By Southwest 2022 with NFT group [Doodles](https://doodles.app/). Here's a [great article](https://www.deeplocal.com/doodles-shopify-at-sxsw) about it for an outside perspective as well.

Your challenge is create an interesting use-case for your NFT. What extra meaning can you apply to your NFT? Each NFT you create should be something more then *just an image*.
