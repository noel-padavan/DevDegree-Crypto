# **Part 3**: View your NFT in your Wallet

This tutorial is Part 3 in the NFT Tutorial series, where we view our newly minted NFT. However, you can use the general tutorial for any ERC-721 token using MetaMask, including on Mainnet or any testnet.

Congrats! Youâ€™ve made it to the shortest and simplest part of our NFT tutorial series â€” how to view your freshly minted NFT on a virtual wallet. Weâ€™ll be using MetaMask for this example since it is what we used in the previous two parts.

As a prerequisite, you should already have MetaMask on mobile installed, and it should include the account to which you minted your NFT â€” you can get the app for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en_US&gl=US).

## STEP 1: SET YOUR NETWORK TO GOERLI

1. At the top of the app, press the "Network" button and select "Add Network"

## STEP 2: ADD YOUR COLLECTABLE TO METAMASK

Once youâ€™re on the Goerli network, select the "NFTs" tab on the right and add the NFT `smart contract address` and the ERC-721 `token ID` of your NFT â€” which you should be able to find on Etherscan based on the transaction hash from your NFT deployed in Part II of our tutorial.

You may need to refresh a couple times to view your NFT â€” but it will be there ðŸ˜„!

Congrats! You have successfully minted an NFT, and you can now view it! We canâ€™t wait to see how youâ€™ll take the NFT world by storm!
